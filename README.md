## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Well, I learned an attribute called srcset, very useful instead of using bg-image on a div to select diferent sources.

### Continued development

I know i need to manage flexbox way better, please any advice is welcome.
